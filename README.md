# 🏢 Customer Retention & Churn Prediction

Customer retention is the foundation of any sustainable business.  
Conversely, customer attrition (churn) poses a serious threat to growth, profitability, and brand reputation.

One of the most critical business performance indicators is the **Customer Churn Rate** — the lower the churn, the higher the customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## 📌 Problem Overview

In churn prediction systems, each user is assigned a **Churn Probability Score** that estimates the likelihood of discontinuing a product or service at a given time.  
This score is influenced by various factors, including:

- Demographics  
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., browsing and purchasing habits)  
- Historical purchase records  
- Customer feedback and grievances  

Our system uses proprietary predictive algorithms to estimate how long a user will remain active, assigning scores between **1 (high churn risk)** and **5 (low churn risk)**. These scores are updated daily for all active users who have purchased at least one product/service.
